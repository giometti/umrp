# Media Redundancy Protocol(MRP)

This application is a fork of [https://github.com/microchip-ung/mrp](URL) and it's born to implement a MRP state machine in user-space only by dropping the kernel support to offload to HW the transmition of MRP_Test frames and MRP_InTest frames, forward all MRP frames and the detection when the ring becomes open or closed.

By dropping this kernel support we can implement a clean MRP state machine as described into the International Standard IEC 62439-2 (Edition 2.0 - 2016-03).

## MRP

This is the second proposal of implementing a subset of the standard. It supports the following roles:

  * Media Redundancy Manager(MRM),
  * Media Redundancy Client(MRC),
  * Media Redundancy Auto-Manager(MRA),
  * Media Redundancy Interconnection Manager(MIM), and
  * Media Redundancy Interconnection Client(MIC).

In a MRP ring, each node needs to support MRP and in a ring can be only one MRM
and multiple MRC. It is possible to have multiple instances of MRP on a single
node. But a port can be part of only one MRP instance. In an Interconnect MRP
ring, there are only 4 nodes where one node is MIM and the other 3 nodes are
MIC.

The MRM is responsible for detecting when there is a loop in the ring. It is
sending the frame MRP_Test to detect the loops. It would send MRP_Test on both
ports in the ring and if the frame is received at the other end, then the ring
is closed. Meaning that there is a loop. In this case it sets the port state to
BLOCKED, not allowing traffic to pass through except MRP frames. In case it
stops receiving MRP_Test frames from itself then the MRM will detect that the
ring is open, therefor it would notify the other nodes of this change and will
set the state of the port to be FORWARDING.

Similar with the MRP ring, in the interconnect ring, MIM sends MRP_InTest frames
on all 3 ports and expects to receive at least on one port the MRP_InTest
frames. The MIM can operate in a different mode where it sends CFM frames on the
interconnect port.

The MRC is responsible for forwarding MRP_Test frames between the ring ports
(and not to flood on other ports) and to listen when there is a change in the
network to clear the FDB.

The MIM is responsible for forwarding MRP_Test frames between ring ports and
MRP_InTest frames between all ports.

## Dependencies

It depends on the following libs 'libnl', 'libev', 'libmnl' and
'libcfm' and on a kernel that has MRP support (at least v5.8). This last
requirement, at the moment, is mandatory for compiling the code only since the
daemon can be easily modified in order to not use kernel MRP support at all (see `ifdriver_*.c` code).

CFM can be found here: https://github.com/microchip-ung/cfm

## Build

```bash
cmake -B build/ -S .
make -C build
```

**Note:** by default the system will use the ifdriver netlink (file `ifdriver_netlink.c`). See below if you wish using another ifdriver.

To wipe all generated files during the compilation just use:

```
rm -rf build
```

### Build another ifdriver

If your system doesn't support the default netlink ifdriver you can use another one just by appending the string `-DMRP_IFDRIVER=<name>` to the `cmake` command line. For instance to use the Kbact ifdriver (file `ifdriver_kbact.c`) instead of the default one (see above) just use:

```
cmake -B build/ -S . -DMRP_IFDRIVER=kbact
```

### Enable DBus support

If you wish using DBus support to remotely signal a port state change, just add the string `-DMRP_HAVE_DBus1=ON` to the `cmake` command line as below:

```
cmake -B build/ -S . -DMRP_HAVE_DBus1=ON
```

By default all Dbus messages are sent to the path `/org/mrp/Event` by the interface `org.mrp.Event`, but you may alter these defaults by using a command line as below:

```
cmake -B build/ -S . -DMRP_HAVE_DBus1=ON -DMRP_DBUS_PATH="/org/act/mrp" -DMRP_DBUS_IFACE="org.act.mrp"
```

**Note:** to successfully compile the code you may need to install the DBus library code (for instance on Debian based system you can use the command `sudo apt install libdbus-1-dev`).

## Usage

First the server needs to be start. Using the command

```bash
mrp_server &
```

By default the mrp_server doesn't display any log message. It is possible to
start the server using this command to display all the log to the console:

```bash
mrp_server -d &
```

Before configuring the mrp instance it is required to create a bridge and add at
least 2 ports to the bridge.

```bash
ip link set dev eth0 up
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip link set dev eth2 up
ip link set dev eth3 up
ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip link set dev eth0 master br0
ip link set dev eth1 master br0
ip link set dev eth2 master br0
ip link set dev eth3 master br0
```
Now that the bridge is created, it is possible to add an MRP instance to the
bridge. The client will communicate with the server and the server will notify
the kernel via netlink interface.

```bash
mrp addmrp bridge br0 ring_nr 1 pport eth0 sport eth1 ring_role mrm
```

It is possible to create multiple MRP instances on a bridge but, a port can't be
in multiple MRP instances.

```bash
mrp addmrp bridge br0 ring_nr 2 pport eth2 sport eth3 ring_role mrm
```
To see the current status of the MRP instances:

```bash
mrp getmrp
bridge: br0 ring_nr: 1 pport: eth0 sport: eth1 ring_role: MRM ring_state: CHK_RO
bridge: br0 ring_nr: 2 pport: eth2 sport: eth3 ring_role: MRM ring_state: CHK_RC
```

To delete one of the instances is required to pass the bridge and the ring
instance number:
```bash
mrp delmrp bridge br0 ring_nr 1
bridge: br0 ring_nr: 2 pport: eth2 sport: eth3 ring_role: MRM ring_state: CHK_RC
```

To create a node that has also an interconnect role:
```bash
mrp addmrp bridge br0 ring_nr 3 pport eth0 ssport eth1 ring_role mrc in_role mim in_id 1 iport eth3
```

By default interconnect mode is RC mode. All the nodes in the interconnect ring
needs to operate in the same mode. To create a node with LC mode:
```bash
mrp addmrp bridge br0 ring_nr 3 pport eth0 ssport eth1 ring_role mrc in_role mim
in_id 1 iport eth3 in_mode lc cfm_instance 1 cfm_level 7 cfm_mepid 2
cfm_peer_mepid 1 cfm_dmac 00:00:00:00:00:02 cfm_maid ABCD
```

And once all the MRP rings are created set the bridge device up:
```bash
ip link set dev br0 up
```
